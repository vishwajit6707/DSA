Third approch is optimal approach

we have to find target value from sorted matrix...

so we will start from bottom-left..

if value is same as target we will return true..
if value is greater we will move pointer up...
if value is smaller we will move pointer towards left..
if value doesn't found we will return 0.

the represenation of code is shown in image..
