the ascii value of a = 97, b =98, c = 99 and it will continue till z.
for capitals A = 65 , B = 66 , C = 67... and so on.


if 'a' is  substracted from any character we will get index of that character.
for example - 
if we substract 'c' - 'a' 
it will be in integer form like - 
97 - 95 = 2
so in 0 index the value of c will be 2
for a = 0
    b = 1
    c = 2
    d = 3
    e = 4
    and so on.
